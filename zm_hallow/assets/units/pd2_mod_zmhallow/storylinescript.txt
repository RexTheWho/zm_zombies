ZM_Hallow Story:



Intro:
Train crashes into a Murkywater R&D facility and the group attempt to make their way into the facility to escape spawn room hoards.
At the main blast door a keycard is required- the group take a keycard from a random Murkywater corpse.
When using the keycard on the main blast door an Ai plays over the speakers announcing the name/rank of the corpse you took a keycard from and assumes its one of the players as all the cameras outside are failing.
Once you all enter the airlock the door shuts and the Ai sees you in a camera- stating 'you are not the person who opened the blastdoor' and attempts to gas the group.
The group must drop down a collapsed hole to escape the gas and continue as a normal map.


Special Waves:
The Ai has detected the group and activated a security measure to destroy the group.
Robot versions of enemies (Bulldozer, Cloaker) spawn on special waves.
